  <ul class="ul--base">
    <li>Your consent;</li>
    <li>The performance of the contract between you and the Site;</li>
    <li>Compliance with our legal obligations;</li>
    <li>To protect your vital interests;</li>

  <ul class="ul--base">
    <li>Temporary blacklist of IP addresses associated with repeated failed transactions. This blacklist persists for a small number of hours.</li>

<!-- PRODUCT SAMPLE POLICY -->

<div class="alt-pages">
  <p class="p--first">Gvinico receives numerous requests for free product tasting samples from its potential buyers. We are always happy to properly process those to serve our buyers best!</p>
  <p>The following is Gvinico’s policy regarding these requests.</p>
  <p>We fully understand that the specifics of wholesale trade implies the client's desire to evaluate the qualities of the offered products. Most of our Suppliers are naturally interested in their products' promotion and provide such samples, although some exceptions are also possible.</p>
  <p>In any case, we are interested in the maximum satisfaction of your any request, because the premise of requesting a free sample of the product is that the potential customer benefits from evaluating the product for their requirements at no cost to them, and that Gvinico will benefit from a wholesale purchase, which may be the result of a positive evaluation.</p>
  <p>When implementing the business process of providing a free sample, we are facing the need to discuss the following issues with the Client:</p>
  <ul class="ul--base">
    <li><strong>The Supplier's ability to provide, or refuse to provide a free sample.</strong><br>
      In the second case, we will look for the solution to make both the Customer and the Supplier happy.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Sample delivery.</strong><br>
      As an importer, you certainly understand that the delivery of any quantity of goods cannot be carried out for totally free internationally. It should not be a surprise for you to receive a sample delivery invoice.</li>
    <li><strong>Compliance with the law.</strong><br>
      The shipment of a small batch of products containing alcohol, which involves providing you with a sample, is associated with the subtleties of compliance with the laws of the countries of the sender and recipient. Therefore, Gvinico reserves its right to refuse to provide you with a sample of the products due to governing laws that can be applied.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Taking the points above into consideration, Gvinico's policy works as follows.</p>
  <p>Gvinico will evaluate each request individually, discuss with the Supplier the possibility of providing free samples, calculate the cost and terms of delivery. The detailed feedback on your request will be sent to you via email for the approval. If everything fits - you get your samples.</p>
  <p>How does this work?</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Please visit the <em style="font-weight:500">Product page</em>.</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2.</strong> On the <em style="font-weight:500">Product page</em>, click <span style="font-weight:500">"Add to Wishlist and Samples"</span> and the counter will increase in the corresponding icon in the right header area.</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Go to the <em style="font-weight:500">Wish & Sample List</em> by clicking the icon in the right header area, check the selected products. If all is well&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;click the <span style="font-weight:500">"Request Samples"</span> button.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Congratulations, now your request is sent to the marketplace for further processing!</p>
  <p>If you have any comments or amendments, feel free to get in touch via <a href="mailto:info@gvinico.com"><strong>info@gvinico.com</strong></a>.</p>
  <p>Gvinico highly values each and every Customer, so we will definitely find a mutually-beneficial solution together.</p>
